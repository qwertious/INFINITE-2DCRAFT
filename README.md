# INMETANTY

This game is fully in HTML, so it should be able to run on practically any device. Just go to qwertious.github.com/inmetanty. Downloading this game is not recommended, as it cannot save your progress unless you play online. 

To run the downloaded version, just take index.html and drag it onto an open web browser window or double-click the main HTML file. It should start running, even without internet connection.

If you want to download this game, please go to a specific version's branch. Otherwise, you could download the game with very experimental features in it and possibly some game-breaking glitches.

I have barely started development, so suggestions are appreciated. Also, the wiki is editable by everyone, so the community can make the wiki for this game.

This game uses cookies to save your game and to give you secrets.

Thank you!
