# INMETANTY
Inmetanty is a game that will soon be in development that is planned to have an infinite amount of updates (I mean I will try to constantly update it) that is designed with the goal of quantity. Other games add a little bit each update, but I want to focus on getting as much in the game as possible.

The name of this game has recently changed, so if you see the name Infinite 2DCraft anywhere other than here, please report it as an issue.

This game is fully in HTML, so it should be able to run on practically any device. To run, just take main.html and drag it onto an open web browser window. It should start running, even without internet connection.

If you want to download this game, please go to a specific version's branch. Otherwise, you could download the game with very experimental features in it and possibly some game-breaking glitches.
